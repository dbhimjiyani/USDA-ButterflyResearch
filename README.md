## Software Purpose
This software is for Dr. Julian Dupuis' research on butterfly species identification (via wing markings and shape). 

## Software Structure
There are two py-notebooks for this. One for modelling and one for predicting the actual photo/photo set. UNLESS YOU ARE CHANGING THE TRAINING, you do not need to modify the Butterfly Model notebook. You simply need to run the predict file with your Faunus, Progne or Satyrus specimen's beautiful modelling photos and let the magic happen!

## Modifying DINNGuS for Your Own Use
I will provide detailed information her about how you can modify DINNGuS to make your own prediction system. To be honest, I don't think I hard-coded anything. I have also kept it as intuitive as possible for Dr. Dupuis' team. Until I post more, feel free to hit me up via email.
